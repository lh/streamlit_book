    "text": "Streamlit apps are just like standard Python scripts in a lot of ways.\nThis means that most of the standard methods we are used to for loading in data files will work!\nAs people working with data, much of what we want to load in is likely to be is data in a tabular format, like an Excel file or Google Sheet.\nLet’s start by loading in and displaying a simple csv dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nst.write() is a handy command.\nWhen you pass a variable to it - like some data you’ve loaded in and saved as a Python variable - it will automatically work out a good way to display it.\nOther functions that we talk about in later chapters give you more control over exactly how data or files are displayed - but st.write() can often be a useful starting point.\n\n\n\n1import pandas as pd\n2import streamlit as st\n\n3st.title(\"Loading in a data file from a publically-accessible csv\")\n\n4url = 'https://files.catbox.moe/otqf4i.csv'\n5dataframe = pd.read_csv(url)\n\n6st.write(dataframe)\n\n7st.write(\"This is some text\")\n\n8st.write(123)\n\n9st.write(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Felis_catus-cat_on_snow.jpg/\")\n\n\n1\n\nWe are going to be loading in and displaying some tabular data that’s stored as a .csv file, so we need to load in pandas. We choose to use the standard alias ‘pd’ for it.\n\n2\n\nWe then load in streamlit. The standard alias is st - this is useful as in more complex apps we’ll refer to the streamlit library a lot of times!\n\n3\n\nNext we add a title to our app. This will appear at the top of the page in large text. We pass the title to the st.title() function as a string.\n\n4\n\nWe then pass in a url for a dataframe. Alternatively, we could point to a dataframe stored locally on our machine, just like with a normal Python script - we’ll talk more about how that would work when we deploy our app to the web in a later chapter.\n\n5\n\nWe pass the url (or the local filepath) to our pd.read_csv() function - we could specify some additional arguments here if we wanted to.\n\n6\n\nWe use the st.write() function to prompt streamlit to display the dataframe, passing the variable we stored the dataframe into to the function.\n\n7\n\nWe can also pass in a text string to st.write() to make it display in our app.\n\n8\n\nThis also works with numbers…\n\n9\n\n… and web links.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at how this app will look in the live Streamlit app below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn later chapters, we will learn more about loading in data, including\n\nloading in other data types, like images and videos\nallowing users to upload their own data\n‘caching’ data to prevent it being reloaded unnecessarily\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe focus of this book is on giving you the tools to create simple Streamlit apps. For this, we will mainly focus on using csv files that are stored on the web or locally, or are uploaded by users. In other cases, we will look at data that is generated by simply running the app, as in the case of discrete event simulation apps where the act of running it produces the data for the graphs and tables that we want to analyse!\nHowever, in real-world usage, there may be some instances where connecting to a database may be required to allow automated access to data without requiring it to be passed to the app, rather than relying on intermediate exports to formats like csv from the database.\nConnecting directly to a production database is certainly possible and can be done safely and securely - but beyond the scope of the first version of the book.\nIf this is your first time working with streamlit, it is highly recommended to work through the book first to learn the core concepts of streamlit apps. Building a proof of concept version of your app with a .csv export or dummy dataset can be done before worrying about the task of connecting to a data source - and often a good proof of concept will provide the motivation within your organisation to unblock the things that may make connecting to data sources difficult!\nStreamlit does provide tools and guidance around connecting to data sources for apps that are going into production; to learn more about connecting to other data sources, like SQL databases, you can take a look at this page from the streamlit documentation.\nThis page gives an overview of how to connect to a range of different SQL database types, public and private google sheets, and more.",

All values in the progress column must have the same maximum.\n\n6\n\nThe first argument to a st.column_config is the column title to display to the user, allowing your columns to have polished-looking names without having to adjust the underlying dataframe, allowing you to more easily continue working with the dataframe itself in later calculations.\n\n7\n\nThe value passed to the ‘help’ argument will appear when the user hovers over the column name.\n\n8\n\nThe format argument adjusts the way in which the number displays; here, for example, %f indicates it’s should display as a float (decimal) number, with the second % sign indicating a % symbol should be displayed after the number. More details about the available formats can be found on the Streamlit website.\n\n9\n\nThe minimum and maximum values relate to the upper and lower possible values the progress could take.\n\n10\n\nThe ImageColumn will, if passed a local or web-based image path, display a small version of the image within the table instead of the text of the link.\n\n11\n\nThe LinkColumn converts any hyperlinks to a clickable link instead of just being text.\n\n12\n\nThe display_text argument can be used to display more user-friendly text instead of the full link itself.\n\n13\n\nThe NumberColumn just gives some control over the way a number is displayed; by default, a number column will include commas to make it easier to read large numbers, but this can be overriden with the format argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor editable dataframes (covered in a later chapter), checkboxes, select dropdowns, date/time pickers and more can be integrated into the table.\n\n\nThe full documentation can be found here and is well worth a read to understand the full range of powerful options available to you via the column configuration API.\n\n\n6.2.2 Pandas stylers\nPandas has a ‘styler’ API, which can be used to enhance table displays with conditional formatting and other stylistic enhancements. At present, within Streamlit, cell background colours, font colours and custom value displays are supported. Take a look at the pandas styler documentation for more information, and pass in the pandas styler object instead of the basic dataframe to st.dataframe.\n\n\n6.2.3 Other kinds of tabular data\nst.dataframe works with Pandas, PyArrow, Snowpark, pySpark, Numpy arrays, lists, sets and dictionaries.\n\n\n6.2.4 Additional arguments\nYou can find out more about the available options in the documentation.",

    "text": "7.1 Displaying charts made with matplotlib\nWhen we want to display static charts, we will often be using the matplotlib library.\nBelow, we create a very simple scatterplot of a dataset.\nThe final step to ensure the plot is actually displayed is to pass the fig variable to st.pyplot.\nimport streamlit as st\nimport pandas as pd\n1import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n2from palmerpenguins import load_penguins\n\n3penguins = load_penguins()\n\n4fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15,10))\n\n5plt.scatter(\n6  x=penguins[\"body_mass_g\"],\n  y=penguins[\"bill_length_mm\"]\n  )\n\n7plt.title(\"Penguin Body Mass (g) versus Bill Length (mm)\")\n\n8ax.set_xlabel(\"Body Mass (g)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Bill Length (mm)\")\n\n9st.pyplot(fig)\n\n\n1\n\nWe import the pyplot module of matplotlib using the standard alias ‘plt’\n\n2\n\nWe also load in a function from a package that gives us easy access to a dataset of penguin body measurements.\n\n3\n\nWe use the load_penguins() function, which returns a pandas dataframe, and assign this to the penguins variable.\n\n4\n\nWe then use the plt.subplots function. By just passing in the named argument figsize we get a single blank plot that is relatively 1.5x wider than it is long. The tuple - the two numbers within brackets, separated by a comma - is the width and height of the image. Notice on the left of the = we have fig, ax rather than a single variable name; this is because plt.subplots returns two variables, and this means we can easily access both of these. We always write fig, ax in the same order - this is just a standard matplotlib convention.\n\n5\n\nNow we use our chosen plotting function - in this case, we want a scatterplot.\n\n6\n\nWe pass in the values to use for our x column - our horizontal axis - using the format dataframe_variable[\"column_name\"], which passes in our list of values as a pandas series. For these purposes, the pandas series is effectively a fancy list - it will primarily just contain the value for that column for each row in the dataframe. We repeat this for our y (vertical) axis.\n\n7\n\nWe pass in a string to use as the title of the graph with the plt.title() function.\n\n8\n\nWe can then use various methods of our ax variable to update things such as the x and y axis labels.\n\n9\n\nFinally, we pass the completed figure to the st.pyplot() function, which will make sure it gets displayed in our app.",

For those, we can use st.pyplot() too! This will be covered more in a later chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe have created the fig and ax objects by beginning by creating a single subplot with the plt.subplots function.\nThis is sometimes referred to as the object-oriented way of writing matplotlib code.\nWith this method, we then use one of the matplotlib commands, like scatter or bar, and tell it to plot onto the ax object we created.\nWe can then modify this object using any of the standard matplotlib commands we have become familiar with, such as changing the axis labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that we don’t have to specify the axis we are plotting on within our plt.scatter() call (i.e. we don’t include ax=ax as one of the arguments) - it’s sufficient to just pass in the data we want to plot, and matplotlib will automatically select the appropriate axis.",

The column layout is covered in more detail in the linked chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo ensure Streamlit apps display well on all screen sizes, on narrower screens you may find that your defined columns are ignored and instead the metrics return to displaying as a single column. If you increase the width of the window, it should automatially update the layout and, if the screen is wide enough, it will respect the column assignments you have provided.\n\n\n\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport pandas as pd\n\n1st.set_page_config(layout=\"wide\")\n\nst.title(\"Activity Dashboard\")\n\n2col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)\n\n3col1.metric(label=\"Total Number of Patients Seen this Week\", value=52)\n\ncol2.metric(label=\"Number of Patients Seen this Week - South\", value=30, delta=-5)\n\ncol2.metric(label=\"Number of Patients Seen this Week - North\", value=12, delta=-7)\n\ncol3.metric(label=\"Number of Patients Seen this Year\", value=1302)\n\n4patients_seen_df = pd.DataFrame(\n  {\n    'Week': ['2021-01-01', '2021-01-08', '2021-01-15', '2021-01-22', '2021-01-29', '2021-02-05'],\n    'Patients Seen': [24, 12, 43, 23, 32, 25]\n  }\n)\n\n5st.plotly_chart(\n  px.line(patients_seen_df, x='Week', y='Patients Seen', title=\"Total Patients Seen per Week\")\n  )\n\n\n1\n\nHere, we’ve started out by setting the page config to ‘wide’. This just means that the page will use the whole width of the viewer’s screen, rather than limiting itself to the middle third.\n\n2\n\nWe set up 3 columns using the st.columns feature, unpacking them on the left-hand side of our assign (the equals sign) into three separate variables called col1, col2, col3 for easy reference (though we could call them anything!). col1 will be the leftmost column and as we haven’t specified otherwise, they will be of equal width.\n\n3\n\nWe then create our metrics, but instead of using st.metric, we use col1.metric (and so on). This is an easy shorthand to assign the resulting metric to each of the columns we’ve just created.\n\n4\n\nNow we’re just going to quickly make a dummy dataframe so that we can see the impact of putting something underneath the column layout. We wouldn’t usually build the dataframe up like this - we’d load it in from a database or csv.\n\n5\n\nNow we’re just creating a plotly chart container and putting a plotly express line chart in it. Note how rather than being inside one of the columns, it takes up the full width of the screen. This is because we’ve gone back to using st.plotly_chart instead of col1.plotly_chart or similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Styling Metric Cards\nThe Streamlit Extras package provides us with options to apply a style to our metric cards.\nYou will need to pip install streamlit-extras if it’s not already installed in your environment.\n\nimport streamlit as st\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport pandas as pd\n1from streamlit_extras.metric_cards import style_metric_cards\n\nst.set_page_config(layout=\"wide\")\n\nst.title(\"Activity Dashboard\")\n\ncol1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)\n\ncol1.metric(label=\"Total Number of Patients\\nSeen this Week\", value=52)\n\ncol2.metric(label=\"Number of Patients\\nSeen this Week - South\", value=30, delta=-5)\n\ncol2.metric(label=\"Number of Patients\\nSeen this Week - North\", value=12, delta=-7)\n\ncol3.metric(label=\"Number of Patients Seen this Year\", value=1302)\n\n2style_metric_cards(background_color=\"#6434eb\", border_color= \"#eb9234\", border_size_px=3)\n\npatients_seen_df = pd.DataFrame(\n  {\n    'Week': ['2021-01-01', '2021-01-08', '2021-01-15', '2021-01-22', '2021-01-29', '2021-02-05'],\n    'Patients Seen': [24, 12, 43, 23, 32, 25]\n  }\n)\n\nst.plotly_chart(\n  px.line(patients_seen_df, x='Week', y='Patients Seen', title=\"Total Patients Seen per Week\")\n  )\n\n\n1\n\nWe import the function style_metric_cards from streamlit_extras.metric_cards\n\n2\n\nWe then use this function after we’ve created our metric cards, passing in the relevant arguments to change the background colour, border colour, border size and more.\n\n\n\n\nFull details of all the available parameters can be found in the streamlit extras documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe six-character alphanumeric codes we passed into the ‘background_color’ and ‘border_color’ arguments are called hex colours and are a common way of specifying colours on computers - particularly in web development.\nThere are lots of sites to help you look up hex colours to find the perfect one for you.\nThis page from w3 schools is a starting point.\nYou can also just go to google and seach ‘hex colour picker’ to bring up an interactive picker straight away!",

    "text": "10.1 Static maps\nIn the HSMA course, we have generally used the geopandas plot method - which is using matplotlib behind the scenes - to produce static maps.\nThis means that maps are simple to display as we can just use the st.pyplot() function that we used for standard matplotlib charts.\n1import geopandas\n2import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport streamlit as st\n\nst.title(\"Crime in Devon by Type\")\n\n#########################################################\n# Read the geopandas file and create a matplotlib figure\n#########################################################\n\nlsoa_2011_crime_figures_df = geopandas.read_file(\n3  \"https://files.catbox.moe/4o0go1.gpkg\"\n  )\n\n4fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n5lsoa_2011_crime_figures_df.plot(\n6  column=\"sw_5forces_street_by_lsoa_Other crime\",\n7  legend=True,\n8  ax=ax\n  )\n\n9st.pyplot(fig)\n\n\n1\n\nWe will need to import the geopandas library to load in and plot a geographic dataset.\n\n2\n\nWe also will need to import the matplotlib.pyplot module, which we give the standard alias plt. When working with geopandas in a .py script or a jupyter notebook, this is only necessary when further modifying the plot; however, we need to structure our plot in a slightly different way to get it to display in a streamlit fileapp.\n\n3\n\nWe then import a geopackage file from a URL and save it to a variable. As it’s a geopackage rather than a csv or similar, we don’t need to define the CRS: it’s already specified as part of the geopackage file. The same would be true of a geojson.\n\n4\n\nWe use the plt.subplots() function, unpacking it to the objects fig and ax by using the syntax fig, ax on the left hand side of our = sign. By leaving this blank, we create a single axis - but the value of this step is it gives us access to these objects so we can pass it to the streamlit function for displaying this sort of plot.\n\n5\n\nWe then use the plot method on the dataframe. We don’t need to save the output of this to a variable,\n\n6\n\nWe pass in a column to colour the plot by, though this is optional; if we did not, it would just plot the points or polygons in the dataset all in the same colour.\n\n7\n\nWe also specify that we want a legend in our plot to give some indication of the range and significance of the clours in the plot.\n\n8\n\nWe tell geopandas/matplotlib to plot on the axis we just created using plt.subplots, which we do by passing in ax=ax to our .plot method.\n\n9\n\nThe output of using the .plot() method on the geopandas dataframe is a matplotlib.pyplot object. Therefore, we need to use st.pyplot() to display it.",

    "text": "11.1 Interactive maps with Folium\nFolium is an easy way to make interactive maps.\nWhile they are not natively supported in streamlit, the st-folium component is a powerful custom component that is being actively supported and developed.\n1import geopandas\nimport pandas as pd\nimport streamlit as st\n2import folium\n3from streamlit_folium import st_folium\n\n4gp_list_gdf_sw = geopandas.read_file(\n    \"https://files.catbox.moe/atzk26.gpkg\"\n    )\n\n# Filter out instances with no geometry\n5gp_list_gdf_sw = gp_list_gdf_sw[~gp_list_gdf_sw['geometry'].is_empty] ,\n\n# Create a geometry list from the GeoDataFrame\n6geo_df_list = [[point.xy[1][0], point.xy[0][0]] for point in gp_list_gdf_sw.geometry]\n\n7gp_map_tooltip = folium.Map(\n    location=[50.7, -4.2],\n    zoom_start=8,\n    tiles='openstreetmap',\n    )\n\n8for i, coordinates in enumerate(geo_df_list):\n\n9    gp_map_tooltip = gp_map_tooltip.add_child(\n        folium.Marker(\n            location=coordinates,\n            tooltip=gp_list_gdf_sw['name'].values[i],\n10            icon=folium.Icon(icon=\"user-md\", prefix='fa', color=\"black\")\n            )\n     )\n\n11st_folium(gp_map_tooltip)\n\n\n1\n\nTo work with geographic data, we need to import the geopandas library.\n\n2\n\nWe’ll also need the folium library to help set up our interactive map.\n\n3\n\nFinally we need to use the streamlit_folium library, which we have to install separately (but is included in the hsma_webdev environment if you are following the HSMA course). From that library, we import just the function st_folium().\n\n4\n\nWe load in a geopackage file. We don’t need to specify a coordinate reference system for this kind of file; it’s recorded within the file itself and geopandas will automatically read and apply this, though as Folium expects the coordinates to be in latitude and longitude (not Northings and Eastings), you may need to convert the CRS of your own data. See the HSMA geographic book for more details.\n\n5\n\nFolium does not cope well with missing data, so we filter out any rows where our ‘geometry’ column is empty.\n\n6\n\nTo set up our map of points, we will need to create a list of coordinate pairs, though Folium expects them in the order longitude, latitude, so we swap the order of the points from our geometry column when placing them in the list.\n\n7\n\nWe then create a folium map, specifying the starting zoom level and the coordinates around which it should initially be centred.\n\n8\n\nWe then iterate through the list of points we created.\n\n9\n\nIn each round of our loop we add a Folium ‘marker’ to our original map.\n\n10\n\nIn Folium, if we don’t specify an icon to use for the marker, it will choose a default. However, this doesn’t seem to reliably work in all instances of Streamlit, so you may need to specify a custom icon instead using the folium.Icon class to select an icon from a web service such as font awesome. More about this can be found in the HSMA geographic book.\n\n11\n\nFinally, we pass our map to the st_folium() function.",

If the value of search_string is \"\", we don’t undertake the indented code and jump to the next step instead - i.e. we won’t do any filtering.\n\n3\n\nIf the search_string is anything other than a blank string, we filter the name column of the dataframe (which here is the GP practice name) to only include instances where the search_string appears somewhere in the name - e.g. if our search string is “Hill” it would match “Hill Practice”, “Big Hill Surgery”, “Chilly Bend Surgery” and so on. Other methods exist if we only want to match the exact string.\n\n4\n\nHere, we add in a display of the filtered dataframe, restricting it to only the columns specified in the list.\n\n5\n\nAll of our Folium code is unchanged; we just pass the filtered (or unfiltered, if no search string is entered) dataframe instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Updating the app based on the map zoom\nYou can do things like filter a dataframe down to only the subset of points that are on the screen within the Folium component.\nTo find out more about this, head to the chapter Bidirectional Inputs - Charts and Maps",

you may want to use an f-string to intelligently provide a filename if the data is reflecting options the user has chosen\n(OPTIONAL) Specify the MIME type of the data as \"text/csv\" - an automatic value will be inferred from the data type, but it is better practice to more explicitly specify it like this\n\n\nimport streamlit as st\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n######################################\n# This section just deals with\n# loading in and using the dataframe\n######################################\n\nurl = 'https://files.catbox.moe/eor4ta.csv'\nname_lookup_df = pd.read_csv(url)\n\nname_lookup_df = name_lookup_df.melt(id_vars=[\"Name\", \"Gender\"]).dropna().rename(\n    columns={\"variable\": \"Year\", \"value\": \"Rank\"}\n    )\n\nname_lookup_df['Year'] = name_lookup_df['Year'].astype('int64')\nname_lookup_df['Rank'] = name_lookup_df['Rank'].astype('int64')\n\ninput_name = st.text_input(\"What name would you like to lookup?\", value=\"Daniel\")\n\nindividual_df = name_lookup_df[name_lookup_df['Name'] == input_name]\n\nif input_name is not None:\n\n    st.plotly_chart(\n        px.line(individual_df,\n                y=\"Rank\", x=\"Year\", color=\"Gender\",\n                range_y=[1000, 0], range_x=[1920, 2022],\n                markers=True)\n                )\n\n######################################\n# This deals with adding the download\n# button and gettng the dataframe into\n# the correct format for downloading\n######################################\n\nst.download_button(\n   \"Click here to download the dataframe as a csv file\",\n   data=individual_df.to_csv(index=False).encode('utf-8'),\n   file_name=f\"{input_name}_historical_popularity.csv\",\n   mime=\"text/csv\"\n   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen using plotly, users can hover over the plot and choose ‘Download plot as a png’.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.1.1.2 Excel Files\nIt is slightly more complex to set up the download of a dataframe as an Excel file.\nHowever, this does have the benefit of being something your end users will be more familiar with -

They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.\n\nThey spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb). Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.\n\"\"\"\n\nyour_text = st.text_area(label=\"Enter your text here\", value=sample_text)\n\nmake_wordcloud(text_input=your_text)\n\nst.image(\"wordcloud.png\")\n\nwith open(\"wordcloud.png\", \"rb\") as file:\n    btn = st.download_button(\n        label=\"Click Here to Download Your Word Cloud!\",\n        data=file,\n        file_name=\"my_wordcloud.png\",\n        mime=\"image/png\",\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n19.0.2 Seaborn\nSaving the file and then serving this is a good way to work with seaborn as well.\n\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom palmerpenguins import load_penguins\nimport seaborn as sns\n\npenguins = load_penguins()\n\npairplot_fig = sns.pairplot(penguins, hue=\"species\")\n\npairplot_fig.figure.savefig(\"pairplot_sns_penguins.png\")\n\nwith open(\"pairplot_sns_penguins.png\", \"rb\") as file:\n    btn = st.download_button(\n        label=\"Click Here to Download Your Pair Plot!\",\n        data=file,\n        file_name=\"pairplot_penguin_species.png\",\n        mime=\"image/png\",\n    )\n\nboxplot_fig = sns.boxplot(penguins, x=\"island\", y=\"bill_length_mm\")\n\nboxplot_fig.figure.savefig(\"boxplot_sns_penguins.png\")\n\nwith open(\"boxplot_sns_penguins.png\", \"rb\") as file:\n    btn = st.download_button(\n        label=\"Click Here to Download Your Box Plot!\",\n        data=file,\n        file_name=\"boxplot_penguin_species.png\",\n        mime=\"image/png\",\n    )\n\n\n\n\n19.0.3 Plotly\nPlotly is a bit different because the plots it produces are interactive - but it is possible to save this too.\nThe resulting file is completely self-contained and can even be used offline. The file could be emailed or placed on a shared site like sharepoint or google drive and would work - though sometimes it requires the user to download the html file to their own machine for it to display correctly rather than just previewing the underlying html data, depending on the platform.\n\n19.0.3.1 Built-in method for downloading static plots\nWhen using plotly, users can hover over the plot and choose ‘Download plot as a png’.\n\n\n\n19.0.3.2 Downloading the interactive plots\n\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom palmerpenguins import load_penguins\nimport plotly.express as px\n\npenguins = load_penguins()\n\naxis_options = ['bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm',\n       'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g']\n\ncol_1 = st.selectbox(\"Select the column to use for the x axis\", axis_options)\n\naxis_options.remove(col_1)\n\ncol_2 = st.selectbox(\"Select the column to use for the x axis\", axis_options)\n\ncolor_factor = st.selectbox(\"Select the column to colour the chart by\",\n[\"species\", \"sex\", \"island\"])\n\nfig = px.scatter(penguins, x=col_1, y=col_2, color=color_factor,\ntitle=f\"Penguins Dataset - {col_1} vs {col_2}, coloured by {color_factor}\")\n\nst.plotly_chart(fig)\n\nfig.write_html(\"plotly_chart.html\")\n\nwith open(\"plotly_chart.html\", \"rb\") as file:\n    st.download_button(\n        label='Download This Plot as an Interactive HTML file',\n        data=file,\n        file_name=f'{col_1}_vs_{col_2}_by_{color_factor}.html',\n        mime='text/html'\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Method\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could once again use StringIO to save the chart html temporarily to memory, then write that to a html file when the user clicks on a download button, as opposed to actually saving the file to a html file on our storage wherever our app is running and then serving that file.\nThat is slightly more complex with Plotly; you could attempt to adapt the code in the ‘Dash’ download button example here.\nhttps://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/#html-export-in-dash\n\n\n\n\n\n19.0.3.3 Static outputs with a download button\nWith some additional libraries, it becomes possible to output static images when using plotly, which can give you additional control over things like the filetype and filename.\nIt requires an additional library called kaleido to be installed.\nMore about the process can be found in the Plotly documentation.\nLINK\nFor our purposes, it is perhaps quicker and more efficient to use the StringIO buffer again, so we will use to_image() instead of save_image().\nOur code would look like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe kaleido library is not possible to use with stlite, so we cannot provide an interactive demo here.\n\n\n\nimport streamlit as st\nfrom palmerpenguins import load_penguins\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom io import StringIO\n# the kaleido package must also be installed in the environment for the saving of static plots\n# to work\npenguins = load_penguins()\n\naxis_options = ['bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm',\n       'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g']\n\ncol_1 = st.selectbox(\"Select the column to use for the x axis\", axis_options)\n\naxis_options.remove(col_1)\n\ncol_2 = st.selectbox(\"Select the column to use for the x axis\", axis_options)\n\ncolor_factor = st.selectbox(\"Select the column to colour the chart by\",\n[\"species\", \"sex\", \"island\"])\n\nfig = px.scatter(penguins, x=col_1, y=col_2, color=color_factor,\ntitle=f\"Penguins Dataset - {col_1} vs {col_2}, coloured by {color_factor}\")\n\nfig.write_image(\"temp.png\", engine=\"kaleido\")\nst.plotly_chart(fig)\n\nwith open(\"temp.png\", \"rb\") as img:\n    btn = st.download_button(\n        label='Download This Plot as an Static Image File',\n        data=fig.to_image(engine='kaleido'),\n        file_name=f'{col_1}_vs_{col_2}_by_{color_factor}.png',\n        mime='img/png'\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nkaleido and streamlit seem to negatively interact sometimes, with the download button generating indefinitely.\nAt present, I’m not aware of a fix for this issue!",

We can then unpack the output of this to a number of variables separated by commas. For example, st.columns(2) produces two variables, while st.columns(4) would produce 4.\n\n2\n\nWe can then use the with statement and refer to the first column of interest. Columns work from left to right; in this case, that means the variable col1 will be the leftmost column, and as we didn’t specify the width of the columns, they will automatically take up a third of the screen in this case. With 2 columns each would take up half, and with 4 each would take up a quarter.\n\n3\n\nNote that everything we want to appear within the column, we indent.\n\n4\n\nWe can then move on to specifying what we want to appear in the next column, using the same structure of with, the variable relating to the column of interested, and an indented block of code.",

It will automatically overwrite the session state key as soon as the page containing the input widget is opened.\nLater, we cover the concept of callbacks; the on_change parameter that is available for most streamlit inputs will allow you to use a callback function to update the session state only after the first time the user interacts with the widget, which can be better depending on your app.\n\n\n\nOr the result of a calculation (whether that’s a number, a dataframe, a graph, or something else)\n\nst.session_state.the_final_answer = result * 42\n\nThe thing you’re saving to the state could itself optionally use something stored in the session state!\n\nst.session_state.the_final_answer = st.session_state.your_number * 42",

Highly adapted for life in the ocean water,\npenguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed\non krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow\nwhole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.\n\nThey spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.\nThe largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):\non average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb).\nThe smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor),\nalso known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and\nweighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb).\nToday, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions\nwith temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous:\nas tall or heavy as an adult human.There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions,\nand at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, during\nthe Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.\n\"\"\"\n\nmake_wordcloud(penguin_text, \"penguin_sample_wordcloud.png\")\n\n\n###################################################\n# EXAMPLE USE: With .txt file\n###################################################\n\n# Read text in for which we want to generate word cloud\n# The read() method of the file object simply reads in the contents of the file\n# as one, single continuous string of text.\nwith open(\"bttf_reviews.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n    bttf_text = f.read()\n\nmake_wordcloud(bttf_text, \"bttf_sample_wordcloud.png\")\n\n\n\n###################################################\n###################################################\n# Advanced wordcloud function\n# This accepts an optional additional image to act\n# as a 'mask'\n# It also allows users to pass in additional\n# parameters that are accepted by the wordcloud\n# function itself\n###################################################\n###################################################\n\ndef make_wordcloud_with_image_mask(\n        text_input,\n        filename=\"wordcloud.png\",\n        mask_image=None,\n        **kwargs\n        ):\n    stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)\n    tokens = text_input.split()\n    punctuation_mapping_table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\n    tokens_stripped_of_punctuation = [token.translate(punctuation_mapping_table)\n                                  for token in tokens]\n    lower_tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens_stripped_of_punctuation]\n\n    joined_string = (\" \").join(lower_tokens)\n\n    plt.figure(figsize=(30,40))\n    plt.axis(\"off\")\n\n    if mask_image is not None:\n        mask_image_opened = Image.open(mask_image)\n        mask_array = np.array(mask_image_opened)\n\n        wordcloud = WordCloud(width=mask_array.shape[1],\n                    height=mask_array.shape[0],\n                    stopwords=stopwords,\n                    mask=mask_array,\n                    **kwargs).generate(joined_string)\n\n        plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')\n\n    else:\n        wordcloud = WordCloud(width=1800,\n                    height=1800,\n                    stopwords=stopwords,\n                    **kwargs).generate(joined_string)\n\n        plt.imshow(wordcloud)\n\n    plt.savefig(filename)\n\n\n\nmake_wordcloud_with_image_mask(penguin_text,\n                               \"penguin_sample_wordcloud_mask.png\",\n                               mask_image=\"penguin.jpg\"\n                               )\n\nmake_wordcloud_with_image_mask(penguin_text,\n                               \"penguin_sample_wordcloud_mask_smaller_text.png\",\n                               mask_image=\"penguin.jpg\",\n                               min_font_size=6\n                               )\n\nmake_wordcloud_with_image_mask(bttf_text,\n                               \"bttf_sample_wordcloud_blue.png\",\n                               colormap='Blues'\n                               )\n\nmake_wordcloud_with_image_mask(bttf_text,\n                               \"bttf_sample_wordcloud_pink_background_blue_text.png\",\n                               colormap='Blues',\n                               background_color='pink'\n                               )",
